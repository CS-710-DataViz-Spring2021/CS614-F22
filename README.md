## The data
Attitudes Towards the Homeless (ATH) Survey at a Glance

* Designed to assess public attitudes towards homelessness and how that may or may not affect support for various policies to address the issue.

* Collected in 2021 from Chapman undergraduate students and Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) users (required to be located in CA). Only the MTurk data is being provided.

* Conducted via Qualtrics.

* Consists of 437 participants, each of which was compensated money for participation.

* Several attention check questions (aka honeypots) to ensure that MTurk participants were not racing through the questions to receive compensation as quickly as possible.

## How to run
